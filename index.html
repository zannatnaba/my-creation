            <p>For the women of the world, this Day of 8th March is an occasion to review how far they have come in
                their struggle for equality, peace and development. Even though about half of the world population is
                women and they have a significant contribution in the rise of civilization, but unfortunately, decade
                after decade women of the world are oppressed, suppressed and their contribution in different stages of
                life is under enumerated. Actually for a sound and sustainable development it is pertinent to ensure the
                equal justice towards women. Realizing the importance of the fact, the United Nations General Assembly
                on 1977 formally proclaimed the celebration of International Women's Day to recognize that peace and
                social progress require the active participation and equality of women, and to acknowledge the
                contribution of women to international peace and security.
